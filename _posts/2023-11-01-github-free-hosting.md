## Introduction to GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages is a free hosting service provided by GitHub that allows you to publish websites directly from your GitHub repositories. It's an excellent way for developers, students, and small businesses to host personal portfolios, project documentation, or simple blogs without incurring any costs.

## How It Works

GitHub Pages works by taking your static website files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Markdown) from a specific branch (usually `main` or `gh-pages`) of your repository, running them through a Jekyll build process (if you're using Markdown), and then serving them as a live website.

### Key Features:

*   **Free Hosting:** No server costs.
*   **Custom Domains:** Use your own domain name (optional).
*   **Jekyll Support:** Built-in support for Jekyll, a static site generator, which is great for blogs.
*   **Version Control:** All your website files are under Git version control.
*   **Automatic Deployment:** Changes pushed to your designated branch are automatically deployed.

## Setting Up Your GitHub Pages Site

1.  **Create a Repository:** Start by creating a new public repository on GitHub.
2.  **Add Your Content:** Upload your website files (e.g., `index.html`, `style.css`, `_config.yml`, `_posts/`) to your repository.
3.  **Configure Pages:** Go to your repository's "Settings" -> "Pages" and select the branch you want to deploy from (e.g., `main`).
4.  **Wait for Deployment:** GitHub will build and deploy your site. You'll see the URL once it's live.

## Best Practices for GitHub Pages

*   **Optimize Images:** Large images can slow down your site. Optimize them for web using tools like TinyPNG or ImageOptim.
*   **Use a Responsive Design:** Ensure your site looks good on all devices (desktops, tablets, mobile phones).
*   **Accessibility:** Design with accessibility in mind, making your content usable for everyone.
*   **SEO:** Use appropriate meta tags and structured data to improve search engine visibility.
